## An introduction to the project

'Plan Chest' is a site which enables print designers to raise their profile on a new platform and to also sell their work to a new customer base. 

The site will also allows designer and customer users to discover new print designers (or check out the competition), see inspirational work and make purchases.

The 'Plan Chest' site will be open for anyone to join, as either a customer or a designer. Both customers and designers can make purchases, but only those registered as designers will be able to start uploading and selling their work. 

## UX

### Site Users - who is the site focused on?
1. Peter, “I'm a print designer and currently only work directly for clients. I've got lots of work that I've done in my free time and want to register on 'Plan Chest' and upload work to sell so I can hopefully earn some extra money.”.
2. Anna, “I'm registered as a designer on 'Plan Chest' and have uploaded some of my work on to the site. I want to charge more so want to edit the price”
3. Preston, “I'm a designer and need to buy some print for a new collection. I have no idea who I want to work with so want to do a bit of exploration before making a decision."
4. Mary-Anne, “I've purchased lots of prints from 'Plan Chest' but can't remember which one I ordered in March as I want to buy from that designer again. I need to look through my order history so I can find the details of the print.”
5. Polly, "I work for a design company and want to buy a print, so need to create an account"
6. Flo, "I'm a print designer and am stuck for ideas. I want to see other print design work that will hopefully give me some inspiration. I don't want to join 'Plan Chest' as I don't have any plans of buying or selling anything"
7. Sally, "I need to buy a design for a collection my company is designing. I'm a business so will need to print the order confirmation with all the price details on it"
8. Mandy, "Someone has bought a print from me and wants to use it exclusively. I need to stop selling that print on 'Plan Chest' so need to delete it"

### 'Plan Chest' site is the best place for users to achieve their goals because: 
- The site is easy to navigate with clear instructions, steps and accessibility
- The site is easily accessible with some functions which can be used even without having login details
- The site has a quick and easy registration process that allows users to easily start taking advantage of the site's features
- The site has an easy system for designers to upload their work and start selling work
- The site allows users (both registered and non-registered) to discover new designers and browse work
- It allows an easy system for customers to purchase print design work
- The site stores registered customers' order histories, allowing them to easily view their previous purchases

## FEATURES

The site is based around a single page layout. 
The design of the site is very stripped back, with a black and white colour scheme and a subtle border feature running across the width of the page above the **footer** and underneath the **navigation bar**. This is to allow the prints to act as the main visual feature of the page. The navbar and footer have a subtle white gradient to soften the overflow and add another subtle detail that doesn't distract from the imagery itself. 

The **navigation bar** will always be visible on the page, with certain buttons visible at all times and others only showing up when a user is logged in. When a user isn't logged in, they will be able to see the buttons to go to **'Designers'** which will show all designers on 'Plan Chest', **'Prints'** that will show all prints available on 'Plan Chest' and buttons to **'Register'** and **'Login'**. The navbar will always be situated at the top of the page with all buttons visible. On a screen size smaller than tablet the buttons will condense into a collapsible **'hamburger icon'**. When clicked, the icon will reveal all the navigation buttons which will appear aligned to the right hand side of the screen. 

The **footer** features an **email address** for 'Plan Chest' which when clicked opens a new window. 

The site opens with the a brief **introduction** to 'Plan Chest' and its features. The introduction consists of two sentences and will appear in the main section of the screen, slightly offset to the left on a desktop and in the centre of the screen on smaller screens. Beneath the introduction will sit a call-to-action for the user, to **register** as a designer. This will be a live link that will take the user straight to the registration page. In small print beneath this will also be some copy that advises visitors to the site that they must **register** as a customer in order to complete purchases. 

When a user clicks on register, they are taken to a **registration page** where they can register as a user of the site by providing their email address, a username and password. At the same time, they will also **register as a designer or customer** which will effect which features they will be able to access on the page when they log in. The registration input fields will be offset on a desktop but centred on a screen size smaller than a tablet. 

Users will then receive a **verification email** with a link to confirm the registration. On successful **login** to the site, the user will see a **success message** which will confirm their log in and display their username. 

If the user is logged in as a designer, the navbar will update with a **'Your profile'** button, **'Order history'** and **'Add work'**. If a user is logged in as a customer, they won't see the **'Add work'** button. If a user clicks on **'Designers'** in the navigation bar, it will show a list of all the **designers' names** who are currently on 'Plan Chest' and each name will be a link. The names will show in an offset list on a desktop and tablet, but the list will be centred on a screen size smaller than a tablet.

On the **designer's names** page, the user can click a button to **arrange the list of names alphabetically** (by the designer's last names). The layout and responsiveness will be exactly the same as the regular designer names page. Underneath the heading will be a button to aid navigation and offer the user to **go back to the previous view**. 

When a name is clicked, it will take the user to the **designer detail** page, which shows the designer's information including a bio, country and their contact **email address**. Beneath the designer's details will be a button for users to go **back to designers** giving them clear navigation around the site. All of the **designer's prints** will also be displayed on this page, and each image will also be a link to the the **print's details** page. Beneath the images will be the print's title and also a button to **see more** On a desktop and tablet, the text will show on the left and the images on the right. On a screen size smaller than a tablet, the images will increase in size and be stacked beneath beneath the text. 

When an image is clicked, it will take the user to that **print's details** page where the user can see a larger image of the print, as well as **add the print to their bag** purchase. If a user is logged in as a designer and has uploaded this print themselves, they will be able to **edit the print** or **delete their print** on this page. If a user is not logged in as the designer who has uploaded that print, they will be able to **adjust the quantity** add it to their bag. Underneath the add to bag button, there will be another button to encourage the user to **see more** of that designer's prints or another button directing them **back to all prints** to ease navigation throughout the site. 

When a user adds a print to their bag, the **bag button** will appears in the navigation bar with the number of items in the bag. A **success message** will appear confirming that the product was successfully added. When the **bag button** is clicked, it takes the user to the **bag page** where the user can see everything that's currently in their bag. 

In the navbar, if the user clicks on the **'Prints'** button, it will take them to a page that shows all prints currently on 'Plan Chest'. This page will show all prints in order of when they were uploaded, but the user can click to **arrange prints by designer** or **view prints by ascending price**. On a desktop and tablet, the prints will display in rows but on a mobile the images will be stacked.

On the **arrange prints by designer** page, the prints will be organised by the designer's last name. The designer name will appear as a link back to the **designer detail page** with the designer's images beneath their name. The images will also be a link to the **print details** page with a button to **see more** underneath the print as well to provide the user with multiple ways to find out more. On a desktop and tablet, this information will display in rows but with images also displayed in horizontal rows. On a mobile, the images will be stacked above each other. 

If a user clicks on **view prints by ascending price** it will take them to a page which has the same layout as the **'Prints'** page except the prints will be arranged in price from lowest to highest. On a desktop and tablet, the prints will display in rows but on a mobile the images will be stacked.

In the navigation bar, if a user clicks on **'Your profile'** it will take them to a page where they can add additional information including their first and last names, a bio, the country they live in and allow them to update if they are registered as a designer or registered as a customer. If a user has already filled in this information, it will be preloaded however if they are registering for the first time the first and last name, bio and country fields will be blank. There is a **submit button** at the bottom of the page which will submit new or updated information. On a desktop and tablet, the form is slightly offset but is centred on a mobile screen. 

If the user clicks on **'Order History'** in the navigation bar it will take them to a page where they can view all their previous orders. The orders will be displayed with the earliest order first. Each of the orders is a button, which when clicked will reveal the **order details** including the order number, delivery address and costs. It will also show a preview of the prints in the order. On a desktop and tablet, the content will be slightly offset, but on a mobile the content will be centred. 

### Existing features

#### Permanently on page
- **Heading** and **introduction** is always on the page as a reminder of the name of the site and what features the site offers. On a desktop these are on the left hand side, but on a tablet and smaller screen sizes these are at the top of the page above everything else.
- **Input box** is always on the page to offer the user somewhere to input an artist name and encourage searching. This always sits below the heading and introduction. Upon loading the page, the input box will have the text 'artist name here' in it to guide the user through the process. When the user clicks inside the box, this will automatically clear. When the user presses the search button, this will also clear whatever value has been input into the box.
- **Search button** is always on the page to enable the user to perform a search easily. This sits beside the input box on a desktop but beneath it on a tablet and smaller size screens. When clicked, the search button flashes with a pop of neon green to show the user that the site has registered their action.  

#### Appear on page after functions are executed
- The **artist column** appears when the user has searched for an artist name. The artist column will consist of a header, short instruction and space for artists' names. On a desktop, the column is styled to appear with a subtle left border to define a separate space from the permanent elements. The border helps the user read down the list, thus aiding accessibility. On a tablet size screen, this will sit in a row with the other columns beneath the permanent elements. On a mobile screen this will sit beneath the search button with the 'song' column beneath it. 
- The 'artist' **header** and **short instruction** will appear at the top of the artist column. The instruction will continue to guide the user through their experience on the site, prompting them to click on an artist. The instruction is styled with a subtle green bottom border to define a separate space. The instruction on a mobile size screen will differ to larger screens, instructing users that when an artist is clicked on, their songs will appear below.
- Each name returned from the user's artist search will appear within the artist column as a list of **clickable buttons**. When the user hovers over any name, it will turn neon green and the text increases in size and weight to aid accessibility and clearly show the user where they are. When the user clicks on a name it will perform a new search to return that artist's most popular songs. The artist names will always sit beneath the artist column's short instruction.
- When the user **clicks on the name** of an artist (or group), this will perform a search for that will return that artist's most popular songs in a new column on the right hand side.
- The **songs column** will appear when the user clicks on an artist name and will consist of a header, short instruction and space for that artist's most popular songs. On a desktop, the column will be styled to appear with a subtle left border across the height of the page to define a separate space and aid readability. On a tablet size screen, this will sit in a row next to the artist names column. On a mobile screen this will sit beneath the artists' names. 
- The 'songs' **header** and **short instruction** will sit at the top of this column. The short instruction will encourage the user to click on a song. For consistency, the instruction is styled with a subtle green bottom border to define a separate space. The short instruction will differ on a mobile size-screen in response to where the audio-player in the preview column will be positioned on different screen sizes. 
- Each song in the column will be a **clickable button**. When the user hovers over any song title, it will turn neon green and the text will increase in size and weight to aid accessibility.
- When the user **clicks on a song title**, it will create a new column on the right hand side of the 'songs' column
- The **preview column** will appear when a song title is clicked on and will contain an audio player and album artwork. The preview column will not appear on a mobile size screen.
- The 'preview **header** will be positioned at the top of the column. Beneath the header will be a **short instruction** to guide the user through their experience on the site. To maintain consistency, this will be styled as per the 'artist' and 'songs' column with a subtle neon green bottom border. 
- An **audio player** will appear when a song title is clicked and give users a way to listen to a clip of the selected song. The clip will not play automatically and the user will be required to press play to listen to a song. When a different song title is clicked, the audio will stop and the user will be required to press play to listen to the new song that is loaded. The audio player will appear beneath the header on a desktop and tablet, on a mobile size screen the audio player will appear at the top of the screen in the neon green bar. 
- **Album artwork** will also appear beneath the audio player when a song title is clicked. Album artwork will only be visible on a desktop and tablet size screen but not on a mobile.
- The audio player will always be **sticky** so when the user scrolls down the page it will always remain visible. 
- At any stage after a search has been performed, the user can type a new name into the input box, press the search button and this will **reset** any previous search results. The column headers will remain. 
- An **error message** will appear if the user has made a spelling mistake or the API can't return any results that match exactly what the user has searched for

### Acknowledgments
This site has been built as my Milestone 2 Project to demonstrate incorporating JavaScript and an API into a site. I selected a music API for a few reasons:
1. I love music and I often think of artists who I haven't listened to for a while then want to listen to their songs
2. I know there is a lot of data connected to music but I have often found that a lot of it is not relevant to my mission 

The design inspiration from this site comes from many places including typographic posters and book layouts.

I have been guided through this project by my mentor Brian Macharia who has given me professional guidance to improve the UX of this site.
