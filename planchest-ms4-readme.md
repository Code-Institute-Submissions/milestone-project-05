## An introduction to the project

'Plan Chest' is a site which enables print designers to raise their profile on a new platform and to also sell their work to a new customer base. 

The site will also allows designer and customer users to discover new print designers (or check out the competition), see inspirational work and make purchases.

The 'Plan Chest' site will be open for anyone to join, as either a customer or a designer. Both customers and designers can make purchases, but only those registered as designers will be able to start uploading and selling their work. 

## UX

### Site Users - who is the site focused on?
1. Peter, “I'm a print designer and currently only work directly for clients. I've got lots of work that I've done in my free time and I want to register on 'Plan Chest' and upload work to sell so I can hopefully earn some extra money!”
2. Anna, “I'm registered as a designer on 'Plan Chest' and have uploaded some of my work on to the site. I want to charge more so want to edit the price.”
3. Preston, “I'm a product designer and need to buy some print for a new collection. I have no idea who I want to work with so I want to do a bit of exploration before making a decision."
4. Mary-Anne, “I've purchased lots of prints from 'Plan Chest' but can't remember which one I ordered in March as I want to buy from that designer again. I need to look through my order history so I can find the details of the print.”
5. Polly, "I work for a design company and want to buy a print, but want to create an account first."
6. Flo, "I'm a print designer and am stuck for ideas. I want to see other print design work that will hopefully give me some inspiration. I don't want to join 'Plan Chest' as I don't have any plans of buying or selling anything."
7. Sally, "I'm registered on Plan Chest as a customer and need to buy a design for a collection my company is designing. I'm a business so will need to print the order confirmation with all the price details on it."
8. Mandy, "Someone has bought a print from me and wants to use it exclusively. I need to stop selling that print on 'Plan Chest' so need to delete it."

### 'Plan Chest' site is the best place for users to achieve their goals because: 
- The site is easy to navigate with clear instructions, steps and accessibility
- The site is easily accessible with some functions which can be used even without having login details
- The site has a quick and easy registration process that allows users to easily start taking advantage of the site's features
- The site has an easy system for designers to upload their work and start selling work
- The site allows users (both registered and non-registered) to discover new designers and browse work
- It allows an easy system for customers to purchase print design work
- The site stores registered customers' order histories, allowing them to easily view their previous purchases

## FEATURES

The design of the site is very stripped back, with a black and white colour scheme and a subtle border feature running across the width of the page above the **footer** and underneath the **navigation bar**. This is to allow the prints to act as the main visual feature of the page. The navigation bar and footer have a subtle white gradient to soften the overflow and add another subtle detail that doesn't distract from the imagery itself. 

The **navigation bar** will always be visible on the page, with certain buttons visible at all times and others only showing up when a user is logged in. The 'Plan Chest' **logo** will always be present in the top left corner and will take the user back to the home page when clicked on. When When a user isn't logged in, they will be able to see the buttons to go to **'Designers'** which will show all designers on 'Plan Chest', **'Prints'** that will show all prints available on 'Plan Chest' and buttons to **'Register'** and **'Login'**. The navigation bar will always be situated at the top of the page with all buttons visible. On a screen size smaller than tablet the buttons will condense into a collapsible **'hamburger icon'**. When clicked, the icon will reveal all the navigation buttons which will appear aligned to the right hand side of the screen. 

The **footer** features an **email address** for 'Plan Chest' which when clicked opens a new window. 

The site opens with the a brief **introduction** to 'Plan Chest' and its features. The introduction consists of two sentences and will appear in the main section of the screen, slightly offset to the left on a desktop and in the centre of the screen on smaller screens. Beneath the introduction will sit a call-to-action for the user, to **register** as a designer. This will be a live link that will take the user straight to the registration page. In small print beneath this will also be some copy that advises visitors to the site that they must **register** as a customer in order to complete purchases. 

When a user clicks on register, they are taken to a **registration page** where they can register as a user of the site by providing their email address, a username and password. At the same time, they will also **register as a designer or customer** which will effect which features they will be able to access on the page when they log in. The registration input fields will be offset on a desktop but centred on a screen size smaller than a tablet. 

Users will then receive a **verification email** with a link to confirm the registration. On successful **login** to the site, the user will see a **success message** which will confirm their log in and display their username. 

If the user is logged in as a designer, the navigation bar will update with a **'Your profile'** button, **'Order history'** and **'Add work'**. If a user is logged in as a customer, they won't see the **'Add work'** button. If a user clicks on **'Designers'** in the navigation bar, it will show a list of all the **designers' names** who are currently on 'Plan Chest' and each name will be a link. It will automatically arrange the designers in alphabetical order by last name. The names will show in an offset list on a desktop and tablet, but the list will be centred on a screen size smaller than a tablet.

When a name is clicked, it will take the user to the **designer detail** page, which shows the designer's information including a bio, country and their contact **email address**. Beneath the designer's details will be a button for users to go **back to designers** giving them clear navigation around the site. All of the **designer's prints** will also be displayed on this page, and each image will also be a link to the the **print's details** page. Beneath the images will be the print's title and also a button to **see more** On a desktop and tablet, the text will show on the left and the images on the right. On a screen size smaller than a tablet, the images will increase in size and be stacked beneath beneath the text. 

When an image is clicked, it will take the user to that **print's details** page where the user can see a larger image of the print, as well as **add the print to their bag** purchase. If a user is logged in as a designer and has uploaded this print themselves, they will be able to **edit the print** or **delete the print** on this page. If a user is not logged in as the designer who has uploaded that print, they will be able to **adjust the quantity** add it to their bag. Underneath the add to bag button, there will be another button to encourage the user to **see more** of that designer's prints or another button directing them **back to all prints** to ease navigation throughout the site. 

When a user adds a print to their bag, the **bag button** will appears in the navigation bar with the number of items in the bag. A **success message** will appear confirming that the product was successfully added. When the **bag button** is clicked, it takes the user to the **bag page** where the user can see everything that's currently in their bag. 

In the navigation bar, if the user clicks on the **'Prints'** button, it will take them to a page that shows all prints currently on 'Plan Chest'. This page will show all prints in order of when they were uploaded, but the user can click to **arrange prints by designer** or **view prints by ascending price**. Every image will be a **link to print details** to view a larger image and details. There will also be a **see more** button under the print to give the user another way to find out more about this specific design. On a desktop and tablet, the prints will display in rows but on a mobile the images will be stacked.

On the **arrange prints by designer** page, the prints will be organised by the designer's last name. The designer name will appear as a link back to the **designer detail page** with the designer's images beneath their name. The images will also be a link to the **print details** page with a button to **see more** underneath the print as well to provide the user with multiple ways to find out more. On a desktop and tablet, this information will display in rows but with images also displayed in horizontal rows. On a mobile, the images will be stacked above each other. 

If a user clicks on **view prints by ascending price** it will take them to a page which has the same layout as the **'Prints'** page except the prints will be arranged in price from lowest to highest. On a desktop and tablet, the prints will display in rows but on a mobile the images will be stacked.

In the navigation bar, if a user clicks on **'Your profile'** it will take them to a page where they can add additional information including their first and last names, a bio, the country they live in and allow them to update if they are registered as a designer or registered as a customer. If a user has already filled in this information, it will be preloaded however if they are registering for the first time the first and last name, bio and country fields will be blank. There is a **submit button** at the bottom of the page which will submit new or updated information. On a desktop and tablet, the form is slightly offset but is centred on a mobile screen. 

If the user clicks on **'Order History'** in the navigation bar it will take them to a page where they can view all their previous orders. The orders will be displayed as a list with the earliest order first. Each of the orders is a button, which when clicked will reveal the **order details** including the order number, delivery address and costs. It will also show a preview of the prints in the order. When the button is clicked it will collapse the order. On a desktop and tablet, the content will be slightly offset, but on a mobile the content will be centred. 

If the user is logged in as a designer, they will see the **'Add Work'** button. If they click on this button it will take them to a page where they can upload their prints. The page will load a form that asks for the print title, a few words about the work, its size, price and an image. All fields are required. At the bottom of the page is a **submit button**. When a print is uploaded, it will redirect the user to the all prints page and show a success message that the print was uploaded. On a desktop and tablet the form is slightly offset, but on a mobile it will be centred. 

If the user clicks on the **bag** icon in the navigation bar, it will take them to their bag page where they can see all items added to their bag. On this page, it will show a preview of the print, the title, the **name of the designer** (which will be a link back to the designer detail page), the price of the print and quantity, as well as the option **change the quantity** with a plus or minus icon, to **update quantity** or **remove items**. The total amount including delivery is displayed on the page with an option to **checkout securely** or to **keep shopping**. If the user clicks on keep shopping, it will take them back to the 'Prints' page with all the prints on 'Plan Chest'. If the user clicks on checkout securely, it will take them to the **checkout page** where they can complete their order. The **checkout securely** and **keep shopping** buttons will only be visible to logged in users. If a user isn't logged in, a message encouraging them to sign in to complete the purchase will be shown.

On the checkout page, the user is greeted with an order summary, showing a preview of the item, a small description, the order total, delivery and grand total. Beneath the summary is the **payment form**. Each of the fields is required apart from town and the form won't submit without all required fields being completed. At the bottom is also a button to **Adjust Bag** which will take the user back to their bag where they can adjust or remove items. 

When the user clicks on **Place your order** a spinner will load reassuring the user that their order is processing. If there is an error with a form field or the card details, messages will show up by the field with an error. On a desktop and tablet, the form will be slightly offset but centred on a mobile sized screen. When the order has been processed successfully, it will take the user through to the **checkout success** page, which will show a summary of the order. A **success message** will also appear in the corner, showing the order number and confirming that an email will be sent to the user's email address. At the bottom of the summary is a **button** to encourage the user to keep looking at prints. 

If the user is logged in, it will show them the **'Log out'** button in the navigation bar. When clicked, it will take the user to the logout page where they can sign out from the site. When the user signs out, a **success message** will appear confirming the user has been signed out and return the user to the home page.

### Acknowledgments
This site has been built as my Milestone 2 Project to demonstrate incorporating JavaScript and an API into a site. I selected a music API for a few reasons:
1. I love music and I often think of artists who I haven't listened to for a while then want to listen to their songs
2. I know there is a lot of data connected to music but I have often found that a lot of it is not relevant to my mission 

The design inspiration from this site comes from many places including typographic posters and book layouts.

I have been guided through this project by my mentor Brian Macharia who has given me professional guidance to improve the UX of this site.
